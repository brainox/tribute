            <h4>Who Was Pablo Escobar?</h4>
            <p>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was a Colombian drug trafficker who eventually controlled over 80 percent of
                the cocaine shipped to the U.S., earning him the rank of one of Forbes Magazine’s 10 wealthiest people
                in the world. </p>
            <h4>Early Life</h4>
            <p>Escobar was born on December 1, 1949, in the Colombian city of Rionegro, Antioquia.
                Escobar came from a modest family: His father worked as a peasant farmer while his mother was a
                school teacher.
                Escobar reportedly began his life of crime early, stealing tombstones and selling phony diplomas.
            </p>
            <h4>Escobar's Wife, Son and Daughter</h4>
            <p>In 1976,  Escobar married 15-year-old Maria Victoria Henao. The couple had two children together: a son, Juan Pablo, and a daughter, Manuela. </p>
            <h4>Escobar's Death</h4>
            <p>Escobar’s family unsuccessfully sought asylum in Germany and eventually found refuge in a Bogota hotel. A firefight ensued and, as Escobar tried to escape across a series of rooftops, he and his bodyguard were shot and killed.</p>
